    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Several packages currently exist that can generate 3D visualizations in Jupyter Notebooks. This review is intended to give a quick overview of the current landscape (March 2017), and consider where the contributions of OpenDreamKit (ODK) can best be directed in order to help improve the user experience in terms of both features and ease-of-use. The packages and technologies that will be considered are:\n",

    "- [mayavi](http://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/tips.html#using-mayavi-in-jupyter-notebooks)\n",
    "- [ipyvolume](https://github.com/maartenbreddels/ipyvolume)\n",
    "- [vispy](http://vispy.org)\n",
    "- [scivijs](https://www.logilab.org/blogentry/8541176)\n",

    "## Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the packages certain patterns are repeating:\n",
    " - Mayavi and Sage's plot3d both generate a blob of HTML with x3dom/ThreeJS definitions of the model + interaction code. This is added as an output of the cell, and it makes the visualization persistable (i.e. the view will work the same with or without a kernel), but it also limits interactivity.\n",
    " - VPython and VisPy both use temporary displays that are controlled over Comm. They currently require a roundtrip to the kernel for every frame draw and/or user interaction. IPyVolume and K3D also uses a temporary display, but avoids kernel roundtrips by using pre-defined ThreeJS view controllers. All four packages should be able to persist the views, e.g. by recording the executed DOM + Javascript to the output.\n",
    " - Many of the packages only supply basic inspection tools (a simple camera to rotate/move). More advanced interactive inspection tools (varying opacity of different parts, adding and adjusting clipping planes, tresholding, etc.) are more rare, but could add many benefits to the user. A possibility here would for ODK to help produce reusable inspection tools for other visualization tools to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of persistence, there are a few things to take into account:\n",
    " - If the notebook is not trusted, JavaScript is not available, so a static image should preferrably be saved with the notebook.\n",
    " - Persisting as HTML with JavaScript is maybe the easiest as it will work out of the box without any extensions.\n",
    " - Persisting e.g. x3dom as a separate MIME-type could enable 3D to work while untrusted (any avenues for code injection would of course need sanitizing). Would require adding a rendrer through an nbextension or on the Jupyter level. Adding both this MIME type and the HTML one on a single output would be nice, but it would nearly double the output size, which can be significant for larger geometries/textures."

    "\n",
    "The following features would all be wanted from a 3D visualization toolkit for use in Jupyter:\n",
    "\n",
    " - It should offer a complete API for plotting 3D visualizations.\n",
    " - More specialized visualizations should hopefully be able to build on top of the API for their own purposes.\n",
    " - It should be open to interactive behavior, while avoiding sending redundant information between the kernel and browser.\n",
    " - It should have tools for inspection/exploration that does not require a round-trip to the kernel (syncing inspection parameters is ok, but this should not block).\n",
    " - It would be beneficial if the API could also be used to generate plots outside of the Notebook enviornment as well, or at least be able to switch to such a tool with little effort.\n",
    " - The API can benefit greatly by being similar to existing patterns (e.g. Matplotlib or Mayavi/VTK), to ease the learning-curve for new users.\n",
    " \n",
    "It is not necessarily aparent which package or combination of packages are the best to achieve all of these, but the following are examples of possible solutions:\n",
    " 0. IPyVolume + SciviJS. Uncertain difficulty of SciviJS integration.\n",
